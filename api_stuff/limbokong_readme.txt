LIMBOKONG'S VOICECHAT (MH)
Limbokong version made with MysteryHunt compatibility. Also fixes some issues with the original, such as:
- Certain players becoming unhearable when players disconnect
- Being able to hear players in acts where they shouldn't be able to
- The distance command not being usable

This only changes the lua mod. Use the Limbokong Voicechat software included with the original mod, found at https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/proximity-chat.200
Note that this will replace the normal version. This version can be hosted without MarioHunt enabled and it will still work as intended.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
First check out https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qb0-AuaajYWNqXSIsM-aDxDzcQQPNSltW2JDYAByn8o
In particular, there is an issue which affects anyone that installed sm64coopdx without first installing sm64ex-coop, at the bottom of the document.
Then, report issues to *me, EmilyEmmi*, since this is my version of the mod and may have its own bugs.
(If you're using the original, report issues to Limbokong or Drenchy.)

Some additional notes:
- While the game is inactive and during the grace period, everyone will be able to hear each other.
- While the game is active, proximity chat will behave as expected for all alive players.
- Everyone will also be able to hear each other while the Global Chat is active. It is recommended to use a lower time to keep things fair.
- Dead players won't be heard by anyone, and can hear each other regardless of location.
- If you use /tc on (as a Hunter), your teammates will be able to hear you regardless of location. You also won't be able to speak to anyone not on your team (but you can still hear them).
- Outside of MysteryHunt, spectators will be able to speak to and hear all players at once. /tc on will behave the same for both teams.
