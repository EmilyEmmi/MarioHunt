Settings can be changed with /omm.

## Basic Moves
**Throw Cappy**: Press X. in the direction you're facing. Hold Up D-Pad or press A at the same time to throw Cappy upwards. Hold Down D-Pad to throw him downwards, and hold left or right (or throw Cappy while spinning), to spin Cappy around yourself. Press X again to return Cappy, or he'll return automatically after a while.

**Home Cappy** in a direction: Press a direction on the D-Pad while Cappy is out. He'll automatically target coins, enemies, players, and other objects.

**Spin**: Hold Y. Unique to OMM Rebirth, this allows for slower falling. Press A while spinning on the ground to perform a **Spin Jump**, and press Z while spinning in the air to perform a **Spin Pound**. Some players recommend binding pressing the Left Stick to this button to spin more asily.

**Roll**: While holding Z on the ground, press B. This can be done multiple times. Roll down a slope to travel even faster.

**Air Dive**: Press Z in mid-air, then press B. Throw Cappy, then dive to bounce off of him.

**Twirl**: Press A in mid-air. This keeps your height for a little bit, like in the New Super Mario Bros. series and Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Can be done multiple times.

## Advanced Tech

### Gork Jump

This tech lets you to travel INSANE distances in the air. Here's how to do it:

1: Roll and build up speed.

2: Throw Cappy.

3: Hold Y and immediatly jump to perform a Spin Jump.

Now you have all of the speed of a downward roll, but in the air. Better yet, if you jump as you hit the ground, you **still keep the speed**. You can also kick for a small burst of height, or twirl for a bit more distance.
It travels so far, you can collect Mario Wings To The Sky without the cannon or wing cap, with the help of this second technique.

### Vertical Cap Bounce

This semi-precise trick is great for reaching high areas. Here's how to do it:

1: Be in midair. When performing this from the ground, it's best to use a Spin Jump, since they're quick to perform and go incredibly high. You can also do a Kick right before this trick for just a *bit* of extra height.

2: Let go of the Left Stick and throw Cappy straight upwards (X while holding DPAD-UP or X + A simultaneously, although the latter is tricky). This will cancel all of your horizontal momentum, which is necessary.

3: Kick with B, then immediatly Air Dive (Z, then B again). If all went well, you'll jump off of Cappy, and can follow up with a Spin or Kick. You can start moving the stick as soon as you Air Dive. If you miss Cappy, you either dived too late or started moving too early.

Both of these tricks are seen [here](https://youtu.be/rNW1cAagrWc?t=39) (video by ColbyRayz!).

## Odyssey Mode

Unlike in standard Mario 64, every star can be obtained at once (when enabled). Some parts of the level will change when collecting a Star in Odyssey mode. When Non-Stop is enabled, some stars are not obtainable, so I recommend using Odyssey instead.

## Cap Powers

Each of the 3 caps has new abilities (when enabled).

**Wing Cap**: Works like the Red Star powerup from Super Mario Galaxy. You can fly infinitely, and hold B to stop and turn.

**Vanish Cap**: You can travel through thin walls with enough speed.

**Metal Cap**: Destroys anything and everything, including Thwomps and rolling rocks.
