# FAQ
(or questions I expect to be frequently asked)

## Why can't I grab Stars/get red coins?
A: You're Hunter. Hunters can't grab Stars.

## Why am I not getting Runner?
A: Those who have yet to be Runner get first dibs.
If you've recently been Runner, you're less likely to be chosen.
For Swap Mode or MiniHunt, you have to kill the Runner in order to get Runner yourself.

## How do I know if there are any Stars left in a level?
A: For main stages, pause the game. It will show how many stars you've collected. The maximum is 7.
For secret stages, you can leave if there aren't any stars left.
The pause menu in the castle also shows how many stars have been collected, even for secret stages.

## How do we do a 16 star run? Do we have to perform Mips Clip?
No, the door should open automatically at 15 stars.

## Why am I glowing red?
There's a setting that makes Hunters appear glowing red. You can change this yourself by opening the menu and selecting the second option, "Settings." This can be Metal, Glow, or None.

## How do I turn off the snow/dark lighting?
It must be December or October! This can be disabled in Settings, called "Seasonal Changes."

## I found a bug! What should I do?
Please report it! Try to find a way to reproduce it, if you can. Issues involving desynced games are usually unfixable.

## This translation doesn't make any sense/is not correct...
This is a kind of bug, so report this, too. Please do not harrass the translators.

## Could you add/change [thing]?????
Maybe, if I think I can do it and I think it's a good idea. Don't ask for stuff that will be too unfeasible. I also can't modify other mods, obviously.
Also, feel free to make a pull request! Note that I won't update this build directly if you do, but it will be implemented next update.

You can suggest features by dming me or asking me in-game. You could also try asking the other devs, but please don't overdo it.

## How do I change the setting for [thing]?
Try looking around the menu! Most settings should be under "Game Settings". You can also try using /mh help to look through the commands, but not every option is available.

## Could you make this compatible with [mod]?
Again, if I think I can. Most mods should already have compatibility.

If it's your own mod, try using the MarioHunt API to make it compatible.

## This Romhack says it isn't compatible!
Don't worry, you can still use it. There may be some minor issues, however, such as getting trapped in certain areas.

## How is [player] so good?
Practice, I guess? Knowing speedrunning techniques helps a lot. A lot of advice is available [here](breakdown.md).

## Can I get the Dev role?
No.

## How to switch page on the help command?
/mh help # (ex: /mh help 2)

## Why does the mod's name start with an exclamation point? Is this a mistake?
No, it's to make the mod load first. Mods are loaded in ASCII order; if it loaded later, the MarioHunt API would break.

## This player's stats don't seem legit. What can I do?
Not much. It doesn't affect gameplay, so I wouldn't worry about it.

## This player doesn't know how to play!
Tell them to type /rules.

## But they don't speak my language!
You can still try to tell them; they might understand the command format.
Or, if their language is supported, write "/lang [their language abbreviation]" in the chat.
Switching languages also displays the rules.

## How do I unlock the secret option?
Your pursuit for this is as a 1UP pursues Mario.

## What's LuigiHunt?
What are you talking about? There is no such thing.
