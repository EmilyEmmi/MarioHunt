    - Thanks to Key's Artworks for making the models!
    - Suggested by Key's Artworks and SilverOrigins
  - Added the ability to "target" a Runner with /target (or in the Players menu). This displays that Runner's location at all times, changes the target of /spectate and /stalk, and changes their radar texture.
    - Suggested by flipflopbell
  - Added Lite Mode as a seperate download. It removes:
    - All custom models (therefore, Outline does not work)
    - The custom sequence used for the lobby (uses the Title Theme instead)
    - The lobby level (the entrance level is used instead, like in versions prior to the Lobby being added)
  - **API CHANGE:** Added disableNonStop, which works with omm and disables non stop mode
  - **API CHANGE:** Added totalStarCountFunc and getStarFlagsFunc. They take the same arguments as save_file_get_total_star_count and save_file_get_star_flags respectively. Return a value to override the stars in a course, useful if your hack has an *eighth star* or something.
  - Added support for the following rom hacks:
    - Lug's Delightful Dioramas
    - Lug's Delightful Dioramas Green Comet
    - Star Road: The Replica Comet

    - API mod has been removed from api_stuff
    - This also fixes many issues and adds language + menu support
  - Added two new options: *Double Runner Health* and *Void Dmg*
    - Double Runner Health: Runners have 16 points of health instead of 8. OFF by default.
    - Void Dmg: Players take this much damage from falling into the void or quicksand (set to OHKO for vanilla behavior). If a player survives, they are returned to the last flat surface they were above. 3 by default.
    - Both were suggested by Drenchy
  - Added /mh out, which warps everyone out of the current level (useful for door desyncs)
### Adjustments:
  - Commands that take player IDs now use global ids (listed when using /players) instead of local ids (unreadable)
  - In commands, players can now be referred to by portions of their name: For example, "Emily" will select "EmilyEmmi", and "Colby" will select "ColbyRayz!".
  - Adjusted vertical wind action: now wind will do a better job of "catching" the player, and cancels into freefall
    - Blocky suggested not canceling the current action at all, but I couldn't find a non-hacky way to implement this so this will have to do
  - Vertical wind now triggers the camping timer
  - Camping timer now no longer appears until 10 seconds remain

  - Runners can now exit during the star dance animation if the "Leave level" option is used
  - Runners can no longer exit any level when getting enough stars; instead, they can exit the level they are *currently in*, unless that level is BITS
    - Again, not available with all rom hacks
    - Suggested by N64-Mario
  - The warp cooldown is now even smarter: it checks if every other destination is the same (so it now activates for Castle -> BoB -> Castle -> WF -> Castle...)
  - For unsupported rom hacks, entering the ending level will now count as a victory
  - For unsupported rom hacks, the ending level can no longer be entered without the necessary stars
  - Changed radar graphics (LeoHaha)
  - Disabled Star and Cap Switch dialogs
  - List Settings no longer lists certain options if they are set to their default values
  - Hud now appears in Spectator Mode
  - Increased grace period when collecting a star
  - Collecting a star now cancels momentum in Stay In Level mode

  - **API CHANGE:** Reworked replica stars; now replica stars use the STAR_REPLICA flag
    - Also added *replica_func*, an optional function that lets the user set custom replica flags (useful if your hack, say, has an *eighth star* tied to something)
